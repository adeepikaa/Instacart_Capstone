Introduction:

Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, lets a user buy groceries from favorite stores after selecting products 
through the Instacart app. Personal shoppers review the order and do the in-store shopping and delivery.

Instacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. 
Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, 
try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session.

The goal of this project is to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order by using previous orders.
